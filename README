Destruct is a tool to automatically extract information from semistructured 
web pages. You give an URL and a template file as template and based on the
template we crawl the original URL and retrieve the information. Destruct
also can recursively follow links that are found. All you have to do is 
mention that in your template file.

Currently we generate the output in JSON format only. But it's possible,
and we have future plans for other output formats. Since we are using Destruct
as part of our project, we will add new formats as and when we need them.
Alternatively you can request a new output format support. That we will support
when we get some free cycles to support that. But obviously you have a third 
option of writing a new output format support. That should not be very 
difficult and we will try our best to answer all your queries in that process.
